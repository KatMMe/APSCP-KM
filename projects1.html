    <p class="p">Freshman year I wrote about Japanese school lunch for my i-search in english class. It was about how japanese school lunch works, from planning of the monthly menu by the nutriasnist and then collecting fresh ingrediants from  local farming, to it being cooked, and then served by studnts to one another. They also teach Shokukio witch is a nutrion curcuilim kids have when their young that teaches them about balanced healthy eating. For this project I did a lot of resech online and watched a lot of videos. I also watched the documeny Nourshing Japan and interviwed the director. I took a lot of notes in this process and used it all to write the paper. I learned all about japenses school lunch and that its not just that the kids have such healthy and yummmy meals but that they learn about healthy eating and build those habits for their life long health.</p>

    <p class="p"> In history class I made a video about the congo crisis. It is about how after the Congo gained idependence from Belguim the coutry was unstable and broke out into the voilince. A leader was voted in but the US though he was to communist so the murdered him and replaced him with a dictator. The Congo became grounds for a proxy war between the US and Soviets that both wanted the countries rich uranuim mines. I did reserch, took notes, wrote a script,filmed , and edited it. I learned more about the congo crisis and the cold war.</p>
